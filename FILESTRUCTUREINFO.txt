Each directory handles a specific part of the whole project - heres a simple breakdown of what does what

In essence there are 3 basic parts of the project

A - Creating the machine learning model
B - Hosting the model 
C - Distributing/deploying the model (basically the gui)


DIRS
1.ImageFormatter - this handles taking fundus images and processing them into a single constant format - in this case a 256x256 RGB Image - this involves auto-cropping images and resizing them - This is important for creating the model and will be used in deployment aswell
2.LocalLibs - here belongs files that are from python libraries, that have had to be edited slightly for our needs - usually the rest of the library is required for the files to work
3.DataGrabbing - Grabbing test data from a directory and returning lists of data and labels
4.NeuralNetwork - where files related to the actual neural network will be
5.DataPreProcessing - where images are converted into a data format that can be read by the model - also includes augumentation of files to make a bigger dataset

Currently DIRS 1-5 are all being used only for model generation - although some functions will be portable to the deployment
